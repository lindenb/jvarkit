## Description



## Compilation

### Requirements / Dependencies

* java compiler SDK 1.8 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html (**NOT the old java 1.7 or 1.6**) . Please check that this java is in the `${PATH}`. Setting JAVA_HOME is not enough : (e.g: https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit/issues/23 )
* GNU Make >= 3.81
* curl/wget
* git
* xsltproc http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html (tested with "libxml 20706, libxslt 10126 and libexslt 815")


### Download and Compile

```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit.git"
$ cd jvarkit
$ make batchigvpictures
```

The *.jar libraries are not included in the main jar file, so you shouldn't move them (https://github.com/lindenb/jvarkit/issues/15#issuecomment-140099011 ).
The required libraries will be downloaded and installed in the `dist` directory.

### edit 'local.mk' (optional)

The a file **local.mk** can be created edited to override/add some definitions.

For example it can be used to set the HTTP proxy:

```
http.proxy.host=your.host.com
http.proxy.port=124567
```
