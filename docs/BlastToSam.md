### Example

The following Makefile downloads a reference , generates some FASTQs, align them with blastn and convert it to SAM:


```
BLASTN=/commun/data/packages/ncbi/ncbi-blast-2.2.28+/bin/blastn
SAMTOOLS=/commun/data/packages/samtools-0.1.19
JVARKIT=/home/lindenb/src/jvarkit-git/dist/
SHELL=/bin/bash
.PHONY:all reads clean
all: out.sam



out.sam: ref.fa ref.fa.fai out.read1.fq out.read2.fq
	paste \
		<(cat out.read1.fq | paste - - - - | cut -f 1,2 ) \
		<(cat out.read2.fq | paste - - - - | cut -f 1,2 ) |\
	tr "\t" "\n" |\
	sed 's/^@/>/' |\
	${BLASTN} -subject ref.fa -dust no -outfmt 5 | \
	java -jar ${JVARKIT}/blast2sam.jar -r ref.fa -p 500  |\
	${SAMTOOLS}/samtools view -Sh -f 2 - > $@

	${SAMTOOLS}/misc/wgsim  -d 100 -N 500 -1 50 -2 50   $< out.read1.fq out.read2.fq > /dev/null

ref.fa:
	curl -k -o $@ "https://raw.github.com/lindenb/genomehub/master/data/rotavirus/rf/rf.fa"

ref.fa.fai: ref.fa
	${SAMTOOLS}/samtools faidx $<

clean:
	rm -f ref.fa.fai ref.fa out.sam 

```
